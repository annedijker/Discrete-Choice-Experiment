I wrote this code for my thesis project at the National Health Care Institute (ZIN) with the title: "Towards Socially Acceptable Drug Prices in the Netherlands, a Discrete Choice Experiments among Dutch Policymakers". 

The Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) consisted of 20 hypothetical choice tasks in which respondents had to state their preference for the reimbursement of two alternatives (Drug A or Drug B), characterized by five attributes (i.e. cost-effectiveness, uncertainty of cost-effectiveness, age, macro cost assessment and unmet medical need). 

An experimental design matrix was generated, varying the attribute levels between the alternatives to determine the relative contribution of the attribute levels to respondent's preferences. 

Mixed Logit Regression models were performed and estimated coefficients were obtained, which reflect the preference differences across respondents.
